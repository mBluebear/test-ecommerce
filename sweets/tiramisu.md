Tiramisu or “pick me up” probably acquired its name from the effects of the caffeine in the espresso and cocoa used to make this dessert. In this version, sponge cake is soaked with espresso brandied syrup and white rum. Smooth mascaporne cheese with Marsala wine make up the soft layers in between.
