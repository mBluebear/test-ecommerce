Although the cheesecake has its roots in Greek history as far back as 1st Century AD, the New York Cheesecake was supposedly developed by a New Yorker for his restaurant in 1929. At Bakerzin, our New York Cheese cake follows this time-honoured recipe - Cream Cheese, base-crust of crushed biscuits, raspberry glaze and fresh strawberries.
